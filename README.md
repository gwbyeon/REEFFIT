# REEFFIT (RNA Ensemble Extraction From Footprinting Insights Technique)

**REEFFIT** is a method to fit RNA secondary structure ensembles to multi-dimensional chemical mapping data. Currently, the method can take data from one and multiple mutate-and-map or mutate-bind-and-map (mutate-and-map plus ligand titrations, e.g. for riboswitches) experiments. Output is a set of weights and expected reactivities for each structure that linearly combine to form the data. If the structural ensemble is not provided, REEFFIT uses RNAstructure to generate a suboptimal set of structures of all mutants.

## Installation

To install **REEFFIT**, simply:

* Run:
```bash
cd path/to/REEFFIT/repo
python setup.py install
```

For system-wide installation, you must have permissions and use with `sudo`.

**REEFFIT** requires the following *Python* packages as dependencies, all of which can be installed through [`pip`](https://pip.pypa.io/).
```json
cvxopt >= 1.1.6
0.11 >= joblib >= 0.5.4
matplotlib >= 1.1.1
numpy >= 1.6.1
scipy >= 0.9.0
pymc >= 2.2

rdatkit >= 1.0.4
```

* To use the --njobs parameter currently, joblib package version needs to be 0.11 or less.

* Note that you should have `RDATKit` installed and properly set up as well (see https://github.com/ribokit/RDATKit)

* In your profile (e.g. `~/.bashrc`), include an environment variable `REEFFIT_HOME` that points to the **REEFFIT** home directory, e.g.:
```bash
export REEFFIT_HOME=path/to/REEFFIT/repo
```

* Be sure to add `REEFFIT_HOME/bin` to your `PATH`. Similarly in `~/.bashrc` or `~/.bash_profile`, include:
```bash
export PATH=$PATH:$REEFFIT_HOME/bin
```

* Check that **REEFFIT** is correctly installed. Test the `reeffit` command by running `reeffit -h` in your shell.
